## Udapeople Project - Give Your Application Auto-Deploy Superpowers

This is the final project for the Advanced Cloud DevOps Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for a cloud-based software product. By leveraging various deployment strategies and configuration management tools, we aim to achieve automated and reliable deployments of our application.

In this project, we utilize CloudFormation for infrastructure creation, Ansible for server configuration management, and Prometheus for monitoring and alerting. The CI/CD pipelines are designed to support Continuous Delivery processes, ensuring that our software is deployed in a trustworthy and efficient manner.
